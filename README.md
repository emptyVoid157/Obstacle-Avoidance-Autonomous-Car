# Obstacle-Avoidance-Autonomous-Car
This repository contains the code as well as complete report of an Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Car that I built during the month of April 2025.
The car autonomously moves about a fixed arena of known length, for 10 laps, and then stops on it's own after it's completion. 
It utilizes 3 ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement and a L298N Motor Driver to control the motion  of the wheels.
